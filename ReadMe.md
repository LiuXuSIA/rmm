## random mapping method (RMM)
 A simple demo for random mapping method published in AAAI22.
 __scripts__ :  the simple implementation of RMM with Python 3.8, numpy 1.21.2, and scipy 1.6.2
 __datasets__ : The used datasets comprising *planet*, *quarry*, and *mountain*.
The underlying mathematical proof of RMM can found in our paper.
