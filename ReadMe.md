## What's RMM
RMM is a feature mapping method, based on the fast random construction of base functions,
which can efficiently project the messy points in the low-dimensional space into
the high-dimensional space where the points are approximately linearly distributed.  
## Why RMM
In the context of machine learning, by efficiently generating approximately linearly separable
or distributed space at random, the RMM can accelerate the training process. 
## How RMM
For an arbitrary set of samples $X = \{x_i,t_i\}_{i=1}^{L}$, where $x_i \in {R}^{N\times 1}$ is the feature vector
and $t_i \in {R}^m$ is the target value. RMM generate a feature mapping function $\phi (x_i)$ for the vector $x_i$ as follows:
$$\phi(x_i)=g(Wx_i+b)=g(v_i)=s_i$$
where $W$ is a $M \times N$ matrix denoting a linear transformation, and $b$ is a $M \times 1$ bias vector. 
Particularly, the elements of $W$ and $b$ are generated at random from a probability distribution, such as a uniform distribution.
Then, for the $X$ that is not linearly distributed, we can obtain a approximately linearly distributed set as follows
$$S=G(WX+B)=G(V)$$

## What's terrain modeling
Assume that a robot has captured a data set $X = \{x_i,t_i\}_{i=1}^{L}$ by the end points of a laser ranger finder or depth cameras when moving in the environments, where $x_i$ is a 2D location and $t_i$ is its elevation. Our idea for terrain modeling is to build a linear regression model between $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{L}$ and $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^{L}$.
## How terrain modeling with RMM
Firstly, RMR can be effective for regression tasks. Secondly, treat the terrain modeling as a regression problem.
Regression model: $$y=f(x,\beta)=\beta^T g({Wx})+b=\beta^T s+b=\beta^T s$$
Objective funtion: 
$$\nabla J(\beta)=SS^T \beta-{ST}^T+\alpha\beta$$
The solution can be acquired through using Cholesky decomposition, singular value decomposition, Penrose-Moore generalized inverse, or stochastic gradient descent.

## Why terrain modeling with RMM
In the context of robotics mapping, the vast amount of data captured by robots in large-scale environments
brings the computing and storage bottlenecks to the typical methods of modeling the spaces the robots travel in.
- The randomness and closed-form solutions make RMR very time-efficient, accelerating the terrain modeling process.
- The limited parameters makes RMR very memory-efficient, reducing the occupied storage space.
- The accurate interpolation ability make RMR can fill the terrain gaps, generating more complete and detailed terrain maps.

## Tips
- RMM is sensitive to the data scale.
In our implementation, we first generate all the random weights $W$ from the uniform distribution between [-1, 1], and the we scale $W$ using a scaling factor $\alpha$, that is the used weight matrix $W'=\alpha W$.
Particularly, we treat the scaling factor  $\alpha$ as another hyperparameter, i.e., the *scaleRate*.
- RMM can also be used for classification task.
Indeed, classification task is a simple version of regression task.
- Terrain modeling with RMR is required to extract the terrain surface first.
